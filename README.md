# Match Game

## Base
### Match Game setTimeout
Optimise the Match Game to use setTimeout. When the user clicks a square for a second time, turn the card over and if it doesn't match the first card, show it to the user for 3 seconds then turn it back over.

## Comfortable
### Match Game Match
When the user matches a card, show a match message for 3 seconds, then make it disappear.

## More Comfortable
### Match Game Timer
Give the user 3 minutes to complete the game. You can't display a countdown timer until we learn setInterval, so the user won't be able to see the time left.

### Full Match Game
Implement a full match game:
- The player can enter their name
- The game has a reset button
- The game keeps score of wins

### Match Game Win Message
When the user matches all the cards, show a special message on screen for 5 seconds.
